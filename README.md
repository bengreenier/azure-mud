# Yet Another Browser Mud
![Linting and Validation Checks](https://github.com/lazerwalker/azure-mud/workflows/Linting%20and%20Validation%20Checks/badge.svg)

This is a playful text-based online social chat space. You can think of it as a hybrid between communication apps like Slack and Discord and traditional text-based online game spaces such as MUDs and MOOs.

It is primarily being built for [Roguelike Celebration 2020](https://roguelike.club), but can hopefully eventually be repurposed for other events or communities. 

On the backend, it's powered by a serverless system made up of Azure Functions, Azure SignalR Service, and a Redis instance (currently provided by Azure Cache for Redis).

On the frontend, it's a rich single-page webapp built in TypeScript and React, using the Flux architecture via the `useContext` React hook.

As a warning, this project (and this README) are very much in the middle of transitioning from something thrown together quickly for our event into something meant for broader use and adaptation. I'm more than happy to answer questions opened via GH Issues, but know that for now this won't necessarily be a plug-and-play project. Work to change that is actively underway!

## Setting up a development environment

### Frontend Dev

1. Clone this repo

2. Run `npm install`

3. `npm run dev` will start a local development environment (at `http://localhost:1234/index.html` by default). It auto-watches changes to HTML, CSS, and JS/TS code, and attempts to live-reload any connected browser instances.

4. `npm run build` will generate a bundled version of the webapp for distribution. If you're planning to push changes back to this repo for use in its official deployment, don't worry about this; a GitHub Actions CI pipeline builds and deploys the main branch on every push.

### Backend Dev

This requires your own [Azure subscription](https://azure.com/free/?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-emwalker). As a warning: this costs money to run! If you don't already have an Azure account/subscription, you'll get a few hundred bucks to use your first month, but if that's not the case you will want to keep an eye on the fact that **running this backend will cost you actual money**. These costs are small for development purposes - you can use the free tier of both SignalR Service and Azure functions, you just need to pay for a small Redis instance.

1. Deploy the `server` folder to a new Azure Function App instance you control. I recommend using VS Code and the VS Code Azure Functions extension. See the "Publish the project to Azure" section of [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-javascript?WT.mc_id=github-code-emwalker) for details. You can also use the Azure CLI or any other method.
    - In the azure portal, enable web sockets for this function app in `Configuration > General`

2) In the Azure Portal, sign up for a new [Azure SignalR Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-overview?WT.mc_id=github-code-emwalker) instance. For development purposes, you can probably start with the free tier.
    - Set the server mode to `Serverless` in Settings.

3) Grab the connection string from your Azure SignalR Service instance. Back in the settings for your Function App, go to the Configuration tab and add a Application Setting with the key `AzureSignalRConnectionString`

4) Set up an [Azure Cache for Redis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview?WT.mc_id=github-code-emwalker) instance. Again, the cheapest tier is likely acceptable for testing purposes. You could theoretically use an alternative Redis provider, as nothing about our use is Azure-specific, but I have not tried this.

5) As above, you want to take your Redis access key, the hostname, and the port, and add them as Application settings to the Function App with the keys `RedisKey` and `RedisHostname`, `RedisPort`.

6) Set up Twitter authentication. In the Azure Portal, pull up the Function App and go to "Authentication". In another window, go to <https://developer.twitter.com/apps> and register a new Twitter developer application. You will need to paste the consumer key and secret from Twitter into the Azure setup screen for Twitter. The callback URL to enter in the Twitter app is `https://your-function-app.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/twitter/callback`, swapping in the URL hostname of your Function app. In the Azure Portal authentication screen, make sure that "Token Store" is on, and add "http://localhost:1234" (and any other URLs you want to be able to use) to the Allowed External Redirect URLs list.

7) Set up CORS in the Azure Portal page for the Function app. There's a "CORS" menu item on the left. Allow `http://localhost:1234` for local development, as well as whatever URLs you're using for a production version of the frontend.

8) In `src/config.ts` in this repo, update the hostname to point to your own Function App instance.

## Editing the map
The ASCII map was created with [MonoDraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com), a Mac-only ASCII art tool. You'll want to open the `map.monopic` file in that, export your changes, paste the ASCII string into `src/components/MapView.tsx`, and then update any changes to the two datasets of persistence identifiers and clickable areas. Note that the coordinates listed in the MonoDraw view are 1-indexed, whereas the app itself expects 0-indexed coordinates.

## Contributions

If you're looking to get involved: awesome! There's a "Good First Issue" tag in this repo's GitHub Issues that may point you towards something. If you want to work on something, it might be nice to comment that you're looking into it in case others are already working on it or were thinking about it.

Fork this repo, make your changes, open a pull request! Once you've contributed, I'm fairly liberal with granting people contributor access, but the `main` branch is still locked.

Pull requests are run through a few automated checks. If the `ESLint` checks fail, first try running `npm run eslint-fix` to try to automatically fix as many of the errors as you can; anything that doesn't catch will need to be fixed manually.
